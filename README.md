<h1>Apollo 11 Moon LOnDing</h1>

<b><i><large>“That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”</large></i></b>

<p>On the 20th July 1969 Neil Armstrong became the first person to step foot on the moon, marking a historic moment for the whole of humanity, and realising one of the most era-defining feats of the 20th century.</p>

<p>Alongside Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin and Michael Collins, Armstrong reached the moon as part of the Apollo 11 Project, launched by President Kennedy in 1961, with the explicit aim of landing a man on the moon and returning him back to earth before the close of the decade.</p> 

</p>However, the Apollo 11 project was not simply about space exploration, scientific innovation, and the widening of humanity’s horizons. At the time, the United States was in fierce competition with its Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union – a rivalry now referred to as the Space Race. The Space Race was not just a matter of technological superiority; it represented a battle between two ideologies, two ways of being, and two ways of ruling. The USA’s triumph in the Space Race was therefore hugely symbolic.</p> 

<p>Nevertheless, despite bountiful documentary evidence, there are many who did – and still do – cast doubt upon the veracity of the Apollo 11 moon landing, viewing it as a large-scale, national-level conspiracy aimed at duping the world into believing in the might and power of the United States.</p>  

<p>Moon LOnDing is a Linked Open Data project which seeks to explore the organisation and representation of knowledge connected to the Apollo 11 moon landing, focusing on three core narratives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The historic and era-defining nature of the achievement, as evidenced in many references to the moon landing in popular culture throughout the decades</li> 
    <li>The political background which was the backdrop and impetus of the moon landing, namely the Cold War and the Space Race</li> 
    <li>The perduring doubts which surround the moon landing, manifest in the proliferation of conspiracy theories, despite physical evidence to the contrary</li>
