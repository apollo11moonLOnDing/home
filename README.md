<h1>Apollo 11 Moon LOnDing</h1>

<b><i><large>“That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”</large></i></b>

<p>Moon LOnDing is a Linked Open Data project which seeks to explore the organisation and representation of knowledge connected to the Apollo 11 moon landing, focusing on three core narratives:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The historic and era-defining nature of the achievement, as evidenced in many references to the moon landing in popular culture throughout the decades</li> 
    <li>The political background which was the backdrop and impetus of the moon landing, namely the Cold War and the Space Race</li> 
    <li>The perduring doubts which surround the moon landing, manifest in the proliferation of conspiracy theories, despite physical evidence to the contrary</li>

The website that presents the project can be explored <a href="https://apollo11moonlonding.github.io/home/dist/index.html#page-top">here</a>.
